# **Website Project Description**

Matheo Schwarzenauer, Jannick Gladik

## **1. Project Title**
Smart Event Planner	

## **2. Project Idea**

This website helps users plan and organize events of any kind — from birthday parties and weddings to business meetings and workshops. It includes tools for managing tasks, tracking budgets, setting deadlines, and assigning responsibilities.
This topic is useful because many people struggle with organizing events efficiently. A digital planner makes the process smoother, more structured, and less stressful.

## **3. Target Audience**

The website is designed for anyone who wants to plan an event — especially:
•	Companies & schools
•	Event organizers, freelancers, or individuals planning private events
•	People who want a simple, intuitive tool without needing professional software
It will be helpful for users who need a clear overview of tasks, deadlines, and costs.

## **4. Structure of the Website**

The website will have 2 HTML pages:
•	index.html → Home page with introduction and features
•	planner.html → Event planning tools (task list, budget tracker, timeline)

## **5. Design and Layout**

The design will be clean and modern:
•	Colors: we will design it in a green color palate 
•	Fonts: the website will be written in Aptos
•	Shapes: Rounded buttons and cards for a friendly interface
•	Navigation menu: Horizontal top menu with links to all pages
•	Consistent elements: Header with logo and navigation, footer with contact info and copyright
